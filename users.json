Standing atop a makeshift platform was Elias, a figure clad in a weathered leather jacket, his tousled hair catching the light. He raised his hand, signaling for a brief halt. People slowed, confusion etched on their faces. \\\"Listen up!\\\" he called out, his voice steady though his heart raced. \\\"We’ve come too far to lose our way now. Let’s take a moment to regroup and reassess our next move. We can’t rush into uncertainty!\\\" The crowd began to murmur, slowly relenting as they pressed together, eager to hear what he would say next. Fragments of fear and hope mingled in the air, leading to an unexpected stillness amid the storm of uncertainty.\",\"character\":\"Elias is in his late twenties, with a rugged charm reflected in his chiseled jawline and piercing green eyes. He wears a fitted black leather jacket over a plain white tee, paired with dark jeans and scuffed boots—the uniform of a rebel. A silver chain hangs from his neck, glinting faintly in the light, and a worn backpack slung over one shoulder hints at his nomadic lifestyle.\"}",
